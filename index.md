# CSE 455 Final Project

## Problem Statement

In this project, we look at the problem of Neural Style Transfer. In the Neural Style Transfer problem, we have two input images, a content image and a style image. The goal is to take the style of the style image and apply it on our content image using Convolutional Neural Networks. 

We first take a look at the paper and play around with the implementation from Gatys et al., A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, 2015 which uses transfer learning by using pretrained VGG-19. We try exploring the impact of the parameters such as the weighting between style and content, how the style weighting on shallow or deep layers of the network may affect the results, and how different optimization methods speed up/slown down training time. We then compare and see how the results differ when when we use a different network other than VGG.

Finally, we run the algorithm on a video. To increase video stability, we add temporal loss.

## Dataset

## Background

## Method

Neural Style Transfer tries to minimize a loss function comprised of two terms, a content loss and a style loss. The content loss is rather straightforward - it's just the mean squared error of the feature map between the content image and generated image at a specific layer in the pretrained VGG-19 network (CAN PLAY AROUND WITH THIS!!!!). 

For the style of an image, we first compute Gram matrices using different feature maps in the VGG network. We concatenate the set of Gram matrices which then represent the style of an image. This is because the Gram matrix represent the covariance between different features/textures for different layers. We then take the concatenated Gram matrices for the content image and generated image and compute the mean squared error.

The following experiments are done based on the implementation of the paper from Gatys et al., A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, 2015 which can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html). We take an image of the UW Suzzallo Library as the content image, the Van Gogh painting The Starry Night as the style image, and we get the generated image on the right.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tony1098/tony1098.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
